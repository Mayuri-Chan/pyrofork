        Parameters:
            folder_ids (``int`` | Iterable of ``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a single folder identifier or an iterable of folder ids (as integers) to get the content of the
                folders themselves.
                By default all folders are returned.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Folder` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Folder`: In case *folder_ids* was not
            a list, a single folder is returned, otherwise a list of folders is returned.

            .. code-block:: python

                # Get one folder
                await app.get_folders(12345)
